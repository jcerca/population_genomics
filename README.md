# Population Genomics

Welcome! Some of my scripts are found in these folders: use them freely. I hope they're useful for your research and hope they stimulate you to make your scripts publicly available aswell.

While these scripts were (mostly) written by me, some benefited from input and suggestions from those who have trained and collaborated with me. These include Torsten H. Struck and Mark Ravinet.

Folder structure:
./PCA/ - single script to do a PCA starting with a variant call format file (.vcf)
